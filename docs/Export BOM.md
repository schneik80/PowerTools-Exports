# Export BOM as CSV

[Back to README](../README.md)

## Overview

The **Export BOM as CSV** command exports the bill of materials (BOM) for the active Autodesk Fusion 360 assembly to a comma-separated values (CSV) file. Use this command to share component data with procurement, manufacturing, or project management tools that accept CSV input.

## Prerequisites

- An Autodesk Fusion 360 design document must be active and open.
- The design must contain at least one component.

## How to use this command

1. Open an assembly design in Autodesk Fusion 360.
2. From the **File** drop-down menu in the Quick Access Toolbar, select **Export BOM as CSV**.
3. In the folder browser dialog, navigate to the destination folder for the output file.
4. Click **OK**. Power Tools traverses the assembly and writes the file.
5. A confirmation dialog displays the full path of the exported file.

## Output

Power Tools creates a CSV file named `{DocumentName}.csv` in the folder you selected. The file uses the following columns:

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| **Display Name** | The component display name as shown in the Fusion browser. For external reference (xref) components, the Fusion version suffix is removed so the name stays consistent across design revisions. |
| **Part Number** | The part number property defined on the component. |
| **Material** | The material assigned to the first solid body of the component. If the component has no solid bodies, this field is empty. |
| **Count** | The total number of instances of this component in the assembly. |
| **Unit** | Always `EA` (each). |

### Flat BOM behavior

By default, the BOM includes only **leaf components** — components that contain geometry but have no child sub-assemblies. Sub-assembly nodes are excluded from the output rows, but their child leaf components are included and counted. This behavior produces a flat BOM that is suitable for procurement and manufacturing.

### Version handling

For components that are external references, Power Tools automatically removes the Fusion version suffix from the display name. For example, `Bracket v3` is written as `Bracket`. This keeps the exported names stable across design revisions without requiring manual edits to the CSV.

## Example output

```
Display Name,Part Number,Material,Count
"Bracket","BRK-001","Steel",4,EA
"Cap Screw M6","HDW-010","Stainless Steel",16,EA
"Base Plate","PLT-002","Aluminum",1,EA
```

## Architecture

### System context

The following C4 context diagram shows how the **Export BOM as CSV** command interacts with Autodesk Fusion 360 and the local file system.

```mermaid
C4Context
    title Export BOM as CSV — System Context

    Person(user, "Designer", "Autodesk Fusion 360 user with an active assembly open.")

    System(addin, "Power Tools – Export BOM", "Fusion 360 add-in command that collects component data from the active design and writes a flat BOM to a CSV file.")

    System_Ext(fusion, "Autodesk Fusion 360", "CAD platform. Provides the design API, component tree, body and material data, and the folder browser dialog.")

    System_Ext(fs, "Local File System", "Receives the exported CSV file named after the active document.")

    Rel(user, fusion, "Invokes Export BOM as CSV via File menu")
    Rel(fusion, addin, "Fires CommandCreated and Execute events")
    Rel(addin, fusion, "Reads allOccurrences, bRepBodies, and material properties")
    Rel(addin, fs, "Writes {DocumentName}.csv")
    Rel(user, fs, "Opens CSV in a spreadsheet or procurement tool")
```

### Command processing flow

The following diagram shows the internal processing steps that run when the command executes.
