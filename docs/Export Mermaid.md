# Export Mermaid Diagram

[Back to README](../README.md)

## Overview

The **Export Mermaid Diagram** command exports the component hierarchy of the active Autodesk Fusion assembly as a [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) diagram file. The resulting `.mmd` file is a text-based, left-to-right flowchart that represents the full parent-child component relationship tree. It can be rendered in any Mermaid-compatible viewer, including Visual Studio Code extensions, GitHub Markdown, and the Mermaid Live Editor.

## Prerequisites

- An Autodesk Fusion design document must be active and open.
- The design must contain at least one component with child components or sub-assemblies.
- To render the exported `.mmd` file, use one of the following:
  - [Mermaid Live Editor](https://mermaid.live/) (online, no installation required)
  - The [Markdown Preview Mermaid Support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.markdown-mermaid) extension for Visual Studio Code
  - Any Markdown renderer that supports Mermaid (such as GitHub, GitLab, or Notion)

## How to use this command

1. Open an assembly design in Autodesk Fusion.
2. From the **File** drop-down menu in the Quick Access Toolbar, select **Export Mermaid Diagram...**.
3. In the folder browser dialog, navigate to the destination folder for the output file.
4. Click **OK**. Power Tools traverses the assembly and writes the file.
5. A confirmation dialog displays the full path of the exported file.

## Output

Power Tools creates a Mermaid file named `{DocumentName}.mmd` in the folder you selected. The file uses the `graph LR` (left-to-right) flowchart type and includes a theme configuration block at the top.

### Theme

The exported diagram uses the following built-in theme variables:

| Variable | Value | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `theme` | `base` | Uses the Mermaid base theme as a starting point. |
| `primaryColor` | `#f0f0f0` | Light gray fill for component nodes. |
| `primaryBorderColor` | `#454F61` | Dark blue-gray node borders. |
| `lineColor` | `#59cff0` | Light blue connector lines. |
| `tertiaryColor` | `#e1ecf5` | Pale blue background for cluster nodes. |
| `fontSize` | `14px` | Node label font size. |

### Character sanitization

Mermaid diagram syntax does not support certain special characters in node identifiers. Power Tools automatically replaces or removes the following characters in component names before writing:

| Character | Replacement |
|---|---|
| `-` | `_` |
| `"` | *(removed)* |
| `=` | *(removed)* |
| `(` or `)` | *(removed)* |
| `<` or `>` | `_` |
| ` ` (space) | *(removed from relationship strings)* |

### Component relationships

Each parent-child component relationship is written as a Mermaid arrow: `Parent-->Child`. The diagram is built by recursively traversing the assembly tree from the root component downward. If a component appears in multiple locations in the assembly, an arrow is written for each usage.

## Rendering the output

Use one of the following options to view the exported diagram:

- **Online:** Open [Mermaid Live](https://mermaid.live/), paste the file contents, and the diagram renders immediately.
- **Visual Studio Code:** Install the [Markdown Preview Mermaid Support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.markdown-mermaid) extension. Rename the `.mmd` file to `.md`, wrap the content in a `mermaid` fenced code block, and open the Markdown preview.
- **GitHub / GitLab:** Paste the Mermaid content inside a `mermaid` fenced code block in any Markdown file. The diagram renders automatically in the web UI.

## Architecture

### System context

The following C4 context diagram shows how the **Export Mermaid Diagram** command interacts with Autodesk Fusion and external rendering tools.

```mermaid
C4Context
    title Export Mermaid Diagram — System Context

    Person(user, "Designer", "Autodesk Fusion user with an active assembly open.")

    System(addin, "Power Tools – Export Mermaid", "Autodesk Fusion add-in command that traverses the component hierarchy and writes a Mermaid flowchart file.")

    System_Ext(fusion, "Autodesk Fusion", "CAD platform. Provides the design API, component occurrence tree, and the folder browser dialog.")

    System_Ext(fs, "Local File System", "Receives the exported Mermaid file named after the active document.")

    System_Ext(viewer, "Mermaid Viewer", "Renders the .mmd file into a visual diagram. Can be Mermaid Live, a VS Code extension, GitHub, or any compatible Markdown renderer.")

    Rel(user, fusion, "Invokes Export Mermaid Diagram via File menu")
    Rel(fusion, addin, "Fires CommandCreated and Execute events")
    Rel(addin, fusion, "Reads rootComponent.occurrences recursively")
    Rel(addin, fs, "Writes {DocumentName}.mmd")
    Rel(user, viewer, "Opens .mmd file for rendering")
    Rel(viewer, fs, "Reads .mmd file")
```

### Command processing flow

The following diagram shows the internal processing steps that run when the command executes.

```mermaid

    B --> C{Active product\nis a Fusion Design?}
    C -- No --> D[Show error:\nA Design Must be Active]

    E --> F[Write Mermaid front matter\ntheme init block]
